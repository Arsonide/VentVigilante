# Ventrix Sync Disks

## Introduction

Welcome to Ventrix Industries, the undisputed leader in air duct and vent system maintenance in our city of towering achievements and even taller monitoring masts! As our newest vent technician, you're about to embark on an exhilarating journey through the twists, turns, and occasionally, the slightly suspicious smells of our city's most intricate infrastructure. Enclosed with this orientation pamphlet, you should find your essential toolbox equipped with three cutting-edge sync disks: **Vent Mobility**, **Vent Recon**, and **Vent Mischief**. These tools will be important for the tight spaces and adventures that await you!

> A word to the wise: if you are reading this and you're not clad in a Ventrix-branded jumpsuit, chances are you've either pilfered these tools from one of our exceptionally dedicated technicians, or you've stumbled upon them in the less reputable corners of the black market. Either way, do the honorable thing and return them to Ventrix Industries immediately. Your cooperation ensures you wonâ€™t find us crawling through your ducts in search of our property!

## About Us

At Ventrix Industries, we pride ourselves on being more than just a company; we're a cornerstone of innovation and control in a world teeming with opportunities and, admittedly, a few too many competitors. Founded by the visionary yet enigmatic Dr. Arsonide in the roaring 50s, we swiftly rose to dominate the ventilation industry, ensuring every breath our citizens take is a breath of Ventrix-filtered air. Our vents and ducts form the unseen veins of our city, pulsing with secrets and potential. With presidential aspirations, and the robust backing of Kensington Indigo, we're not just powering the airflow - we're setting the stage for a Ventrix-led future where efficiency, security, and governance are as reliable as our world-class ventilation systems.

## Your Toolbox

Next up, let's dissect your toolbox. We'll dive into the nitty-gritty of each sync disk, each equipped with two unique but related upgrade paths designed to improve your vent maintenance efficiency in the field. Because a more efficient technician is our best asset in maximizing customer satisfaction (and our bottom line).

### Vent Mobility

* **Chute Scoot**: Slip through the vents as smoothly as a TV dinner after midnight. This sync disk makes you move faster through vents by secreting a sleek, friction reducing coating. ***Reminder***: Vent racing is strictly prohibited by Ventrix company policy.

* **Duct Parkour**: Sometimes the job calls for a grand entrance, or quick exit! Get in and out of vents with the flair of a circus acrobat and the grace of a ballet dancer. You will be able to enter and exit vents further away, faster than ever before, and have them automatically close behind you.

### Vent Recon

* **Acoustic Mapping**: Initially designed to sense sound waves emitted by tapping a small specialized metal rod on the vent, technicians have found that throwing money away also works! Throwing a coin against air ducts sends out an echolocation pulse (like a bat). This is visualized for you to see air ducts and vents through walls.

* **Grate Snooping**: When working near vent exits, this disk not only highlights customers and potentially hazardous security devices through walls, but also allows you to fast-forward time! Perfect for those extended repair sessions. While Ventrix officially discourages extended shifts, we understand sometimes the job knows no clock. Bring snacks.

### Vent Mischief

* **Shaft Specter**: Avoid disturbing customers with footsteps or chattering teeth during long maintenance sessions - this disk dramatically lowers the chance of you making noises as you move through vents, and makes you immune to the cold while performing vent maintenance.

* **Tunnel Terror**: This disk was designed for breaking out of vents in toxic gas emergencies. It lets you loudly burst forth from air vents in a way that will probably startle onlooking customers in private areas. It also makes you immune to toxic gas in vents. Use with caution - this disk may unleash your inner vent goblin.

## Installation

### r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager installation

If you are using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/oneapp/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) for installation, simply download the mod from the Online tab.

### Manual installation

Follow these steps:

1. Download BepInEx from the official repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files into the same folder as the "Shadows of Doubt.exe" executable.
3. Launch the game, load the main menu, and then exit the game.
4. Download the latest version of the mod from the Releases page on either Thunderstore or Github. Unzip the files and place them in corresponding directories within "Shadows of Doubt\BepInEx...". Also, download the [SOD.Common](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/Venomaus/SODCommon/) dependency.
5. Start the game.

## Configuration

In r2modman you should see "Config editor" on the left, in the "Other" section. If you click on that and then open up BepInEx\config\VentrixSyncDisks.cfg and click "Edit config", you will have many options available to you to configure Ventrix Sync Disks to your liking. Just click "Save" when you are done.

> Ventrix Sync Disks starts with default settings that are balanced for a fun vanilla gameplay experience. There are a LOT of options below, but you don't need to change them unless you want to. You can skip everything below and go play the game now if you want.

Each sync disk has extensive configuration options allowing you to change everything about the behavior of them. These changes will be reflected in the skill descriptions in-game, but be warned that you can absolutely break the game by, for example, making yourself move through vents 500x faster.

You will see many options that say (All Upgrades) below, this is just to keep this document shorter. What this means is that this option is actually three options: one reflecting the sync disk with no upgrades, one for the first upgrade, and one for the second upgrade. For many options you can adjust these for each level individually.

> If you do not see VentrixSyncDisks.cfg in your options, click "Start modded" to launch the game, then close both the game and r2modman. When you launch r2modman again, the config file will be there.

> Note that the mod caches a lot of things when it starts, so it's a good idea to modify these settings before you launch the game, not while the game is running.
