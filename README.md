## Installation

### r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager installation

If you are using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/oneapp/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) for installation, simply download the mod from the Online tab.

### Manual installation

Follow these steps:

1. Download BepInEx from the official repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files into the same folder as the "Shadows of Doubt.exe" executable.
3. Launch the game, load the main menu, and then exit the game.
4. Download the latest version of the mod from the Releases page on either Thunderstore or Github. Unzip the files and place them in corresponding directories within "Shadows of Doubt\BepInEx...". Also, download the [SOD.Common](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/Venomaus/SODCommon/) dependency.
5. Start the game.

### Configuratio

If you read anything in this document, read this section.

In r2modman you should see "Config editor" on the left, in the "Other" section. If you click on that and then open up BepInEx\config\VentVigilante.cfg and click "Edit config", you will have many options available to you to configure Vent Vigilante to your liking. Just click "Save" when you are done.

> If you do not see Vent Vigilante.cfg in your options, click "Start modded" to launch the game, then close both the game and r2modman. When you launch r2modman again, the config file will be there.

> Note that the mod caches a lot of things when it starts, so it's a good idea to modify these settings before you launch the game, not while the game is running.
